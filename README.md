## Translator MTG

Translator MTG is a program that, together with the deck export plugins of the game Tabletop Simulator, allows us to translate our Magic: The Gathering deck into multiple languages.

### Installation Process
1. Download the `.exe` file inside the `build` folder.
2. To modify the project, use:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

### Usage Steps
1. Navigate to the directory containing your `.json` files with your decks, or copy them into the directory where your executable is located.
2. Once the process is completed, copy the modified file to the `Save Objects` folder of Tabletop Simulator.
3. If the executable is already in the `Save Objects` folder, no action is needed as the program will directly modify the original file.
